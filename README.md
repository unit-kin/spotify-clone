THIS IS A SPOTIFY CLONE APP 

this is a preview build more updates coming up soon 

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm install react-scripts`

this is to install all the dependencies 

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm firebase`

for hosting demo purposes I recommend firebase hosting as it is free
incase of any issues contact me on `Email-akkangara8@gmail.com`


### `sudo npm install -g firebase-tools`


### `firebase init`
 -create new project or select exsisting
 -Using spacebar select hosting option then press enter
 make sure you type in build so that firebase will host the build 
 otherwise it will be messed up 

### `npm run build` 

### `firebase deploy` 
deploys the application and provides a live web-app link
